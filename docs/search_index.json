Make sure you are on the VAI network, not VAI guest. Step 2. - For Mac user: open terminal, type ssh you_vai_user_name@submit.hpc.vai.org, and type your password. - For Windows user, open MobarXterm, click new session under “Session”. Click on “SSH”, type “submit.hpc.vai.org” as Remote host name, your user name for VAI as username, click “OK”. You need to type your VAI password. 2.2 Commands you need to learn for Ex2: Cmd1. pwd - displays the current working directory It is useful when directory changes are made frequently. Cmd2. ls - list content This command lists directory contents. Without anything specified after ls, it will list the current directory. It can also list content of another directory. You might not have any file in your home directory at this point, you can type touch file.txt to create your first file. ls /varidata/ ls -lht – show more details of the files. Cmd3. mkdir – create a new directory Syntax is mkdir new_directory name. You can create a new directory in the current directory or another directory. For example, mkdir projects will create a new directory called “projects” in your home directory. Cmd4. mv – move and rename file The arguments in mv are similar to the cp command. To move a file, syntax is mv file_name destination’s directory. For example: mv file.txt /home/username/projects, will move file.txt from current directory to /home/username/projects To rename a file, the syntax is mv old_file_name.txt new_file_name.txt Cmd5. cd – change directory Let’s say you’re in /home/username/ and you want to go to projects, a subdirectory of documents, type: cd projects Another scenario is if you want to switch to a completely new directory, for example, /home/username/research, you need to type cd followed by the directory’s absolute path: cd /home/username/research Tip, ./ means current working directory. ../ means the parent directory. / is the root directory, ~ is home directory. Pay attention to these differences. Cmd6. rm – remove a file rm file_name will delete the file. rm -r dir will delete the whole directory. Note, rm is permanent. Unlike Window and Mac where deleted files can be recovered from the Trash. Think carefully before you type rm. Cmd7. cp – copy a file or a dir Syntax: cp old_file new_file for file copy. cp -r old_dir new_dir for directory copy. Cmd8. find – look for a file based on its name Typical usage: find /home/username -name notes.txt will search for a file called notes.txt within your home directory and its subdirectories. Tip, if you want to find all pdf files under the current directory, do find . -name “*.pdf”. Here, * is called wildcard, it will match any name. 2.3 Ex2: file navigation Use the commands you just learned, go to /varidata/researchtemp/hpctmp/HPC_mini_workshop/Ex2 List files in this the directory, how many files and directories did you see? Which file was created the earliest? Make a new directory in your home directory called “hpc_mini_workshop” Try to copy (not to move) one of the fastsq files to hpc_mini_workshop you just created in your home directory. Use “find” command to list all the fastq files (file ends with fq) in /varidata/researchtemp/hpctmp/HPC_mini_workshop/Ex2 2.4 Commands you need to learn for Ex 3 Cmd9. head &amp; tail – view the first and last a few rows/lines of a file Usage: head -n 5 file_name will display as standard output (stdout) the first 5 lines/rows of the a file. Without -n, it will default display 10 lines. Cmd10. less &amp; more – view content of a file one page at a time. Tip, you can use q key to quit the viewing. Cmd11. cat – list the contents of a file as stdout cat (short for concatenate) is one of the most frequently used commands. To run this command, type cat followed by the file’s name: cat file.txt Combine two files: cat file1 file2 It is useful to pipe the content of the file into another command. 2.4.1 So, what is pipe? A pipe is a form of redirection (transfer of sdout to other destinations). You can send output from one command/program/process to another command/program/process for further processing. You can do so by using the pipe character |. Lastly, you can direct the stdout of any command to a new file use &gt;. For example: bwa mem genome.fa reads.fastq | samtools sort -o output.bam cat protein.fa | head -5 &gt; first_5_protein.fa Cmd 12. grep – search a pattern by line grep “GCGGA” sequence_file.fastq will output lines with GCGGA in it. Cmd 13. wc - counting words, lines, and bytes in files Without any specification, wc will output three numbers. The most useful is wc -l, it only outputs the line number. 2.5 Exercise 3: File viewing and manipulation Count how many lines in the fastq file you just copied to your home directory. Create a file that only has protein sequence name from file: /varidata/researchtemp/hpctmp/HPC_mini_workshop/Ex2/protein_seq.fa (please copy this file to your home directory first). Hint, use grep to look for pattern that is shared among all protein names; then use redirection to create a new file. Copy a different fastq file from /varidata/researchtemp/hpctmp/HPC_mini_workshop/Ex2/ to your home directory, and combine two fq files into a new file called combined.fq.

Four RNA-seq fastq files representing paired-end reads from two human samples have already been downloaded from GSE52778. To save time for the workshop, each file has been randomly subsetted to just a small fraction of the total reads. Here we will: Copy these fastq files to a private project directory for each user. Use basic Linux commands to learn some characteristics of these files, and compare the results to results from FastQC, which we will also run. Use Salmon to align (pseudo-align) these reads to the hg38 reference transcriptome and get transcripts-per-million (TPMs) for each annotated gene. 4.1 Start up an interactive job Remember we try to avoid running computationally-intensive operations on the submit node directly. Where a formal script is not needed, we can start up an ‘interactive job’. Once an interactive job is started, we can use the commandline as before but now we are using pre-allocated computational resources. qsub -I -l nodes=1:ppn=1 -l mem=32gb -l walltime=2:00:00 # one way to verify that we have started an interactive successfully is to run qstat # to show only jobs submitted by ourselves, we use the `-u` option followed by our username. qstat -u username 4.2 Create a project directory for yourself and a subdirectory for storing the raw fastq files It is good practice to try to make a separate directory for each project to minimize the risk of accidentally editing other files. It is also good to store raw data in its own location and not make any modifications to them. cd /varidata/researchtemp/hpctmp/HPC_mini_workshop/Part3 mkdir firstname.lastname cd firstname.lastname mkdir fastqs 4.3 Copy fastqs to working directory # copy the md5sum file which will be used to verify successful file transfers. cp /varidata/researchtemp/hpctmp/BBC/hpc_workshop_fqs/md5sum.txt ./fastqs/ # copy the fastqs cp /varidata/researchtemp/hpctmp/BBC/hpc_workshop_fqs/*fastq.gz ./fastqs/ 4.4 Check that the files transferred properly Run the following command. The tool will compare the md5sums in the md5sum.txt file to the md5sums calculated for the files in your directory currently. If each line says ‘OK’, then the transfer was successful. cd fastqs md5sum -c md5sum.txt ## SRR1039520_1.fastq.gz: OK ## SRR1039520_2.fastq.gz: OK ## SRR1039521_1.fastq.gz: OK ## SRR1039521_2.fastq.gz: OK For the next steps, go back to the project directory. cd .. 4.5 Use zcat to take a look into fastq.gz files Note that a .gz file suffix means that the file is compressed and running the usual cat on it will not return human-readable results. The zcat command first decompresses the file then prints the results. Note the matching fastq IDs in the R1 and R2 files. Valid paired fastq files always have matching read IDs throughout the entire file. zcat fastqs/SRR1039520_1.fastq.gz | head ## @SRR1039520.19151550 19151550 length=63 ## CCAGGACATCAAGAAGCCAGCTGAAGATGAGTGGGGTAAAACCCCAGACGCCATGAAAGCTGC ## + ## HJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJIJJJJJJJJIJJJJJGGJJJFHIJIIJJIGHHFFFDDDDDCDDDCDD ## @SRR1039520.3404519 3404519 length=63 ## TGAGACATGGTTATAGATAAGAGAGTACAAAATGACTCTTTTTCCTGTCAATTGAAATTTAAA ## + ## HIGDFBGIIJBHGIIEHIIJIJIIIEGGIIIHGIJJIJJJIIJGIIIIGIEHIGDCHHIICG7 ## @SRR1039520.16253787 16253787 length=63 ## CAGGAGACCAAAGACACTGCAATTTGTGTGTTTTCTACAGGGTGCTTTAGATGACGTCTCATT Now look at the R2 file. zcat fastqs/SRR1039520_2.fastq.gz | head ## @SRR1039520.19151550 19151550 length=63 ## GAGATGGGGGTCCGTGCGGGCAGAACCCAGGGCATGAAGATCCAAAAGGGCCTGGTTCAGCTT ## + ## HJJJJJJJJJHHHIGIJIJJJJJJJHHHHFFFDDEEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD ## @SRR1039520.3404519 3404519 length=63 ## TTTGACCCTAGTATTGGCAATAGCCCTTTGCTATTTATATAATTAAAACTTTTCTTTAAATTT ## + ## HIJIJJJJIIEHGIGIIIDGIJJJJIIJJJIJJJIJJJIIIJJJJIJJGCHIJJJJJIJIJII ## @SRR1039520.16253787 16253787 length=63 ## TACAGTTTGCAAAAGATGTCCAGATGGGTTCTTCTCAAATGAGACGTCATCTAAAGCACCCTG 4.6 Use wc to see how many reads are in a fastq file and how long they are. Remember that we can use man wc to see what the different options such as -l and -m do. This command counts the new line characters at the end of each line. Typically, this corresponds to the number of lines in a file. Recall that each read is represented by 4 lines in a fastq file, so we need to divide the results of wc -l by 4 to get the number of reads. zcat fastqs/SRR1039520_1.fastq.gz | wc -l ## 2000000 This command counts the number of characters in the sequence line (second line) in the first read in the file. you may notice that the results of wc -m will be 1 higher than the actual read length. This is because the tool counts the newline character also. zcat fastqs/SRR1039520_1.fastq.gz | head -n2 | tail -n1 | wc -m ## 64 Record these numbers so that you can compare these to the output from FastQC (a commonly used tool for checking the quality of fastq files) which we will run below. 4.7 How to see what packages are installed on HPC. If you simply type module av, you will see all the modules available. There are a lot of modules installed. To parse through these more easily, we can pipe the results of module av into tools such as head to print just the first ‘n’ lines and grep to search for modules with specific keywords. There is a trick, though. The results of module av go to stderr, so we need to redirect stderr to stdout using 2&gt;&amp;1 before the pipe. Print the first 50 lines. module av 2&gt;&amp;1 | head -n50 ## --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- /cm/local/modulefiles --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ##

The job script code is below. Don’t worry about the specifics of this code for now. Simply, copy the code and paste into your text editor to make your job script. Save the script as run_salmon.sh and ensure that it is in our project directory containing the fastqs/ subfolder. #PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=3 #PBS -l mem=36gb #PBS -l walltime=1:00:00 #PBS -N salmon #PBS -o salmon.o #PBS -e salmon.e set -euo pipefail # see explanation at https://gist.github.com/mohanpedala/1e2ff5661761d3abd0385e8223e16425?permalink_comment_id=3945021 start_time=$(date +&quot;%T&quot;) # You need to navigate to your project directory.

The job should complete in about 2 minutes. qsub run_salmon.sh # check on the status of your job qstat -u firstname.lastname 4.11 Check the job logs to see if job finished running It is good practice to check the job logs after your job is done to ensure that the job completed successfully. If there is an error, the output files may not be reliable or could be incomplete.

These values can be found in the quant.sf file in each sample’s folder. Let’s take a look at one of these files to figure out the format of these files. head salmon/SRR1039520/quant.sf ## Name Length EffectiveLength TPM NumReads ## ENST00000456328.2 1657 1502.015 0.000000 0.000 ## ENST00000450305.2 632 477.136 0.000000 0.000 ## ENST00000488147.1 1351 1196.015 0.000000 0.000 ## ENST00000619216.1 68 1.932 0.000000 0.000 ## ENST00000473358.1 712 557.094 0.000000 0.000 ## ENST00000469289.1 535 380.252 0.000000 0.000 ## ENST00000607096.1 138 24.897 0.000000 0.000 ## ENST00000417324.1 1187 1032.015 0.000000 0.000 ## ENST00000461467.1 590 435.180 0.000000 0.000 We can see that the TPMs are in the 4th column of this file. We can also see that the transcript IDs are in ENSEMBL format. If we look up MUC1 on Ensembl, we will find that the canonical transcript is ENST00000620103, so let’s grep for this transcript ID. Look for this transript for one specific sample. grep &#39;ENST00000620103&#39; salmon/SRR1039520/quant.sf ## ENST00000620103.4 1811 1656.015 0.000000 0.000 Look across all the samples at the same time. We can see that ‘SRR1039521’ has a TPM of 13.1 for MUC1 compared to 0 for ‘SRR1039520’. Recall that the fastq files for this exercise were subsetted to a very small number of reads so don’t interpret these results seriously. grep &#39;ENST00000620103&#39; salmon/*/quant.sf ## salmon/SRR1039520/quant.sf:ENST00000620103.4 1811 1656.015 0.000000 0.000 ## salmon/SRR1039521/quant.sf:ENST00000620103.4 1811 1655.481 13.145898 5.723 4.13 Use an interactive job to run multiQC on the Salmon and FastQC output As our final exercise, let’s run a tool called multiQC to summarize the results from FastQC and Salmon. Using the output from multiQC, we will be able to assess both the quality of the fastq sequences themselves and how well they match up with the reference transcriptome (mapping rate), and other useful information. We will start up another interactive job to do this. qsub -I -l nodes=1:ppn=1 -l mem=32gb -l walltime=1:00:00 # go back to your project directory cd /varidata/researchtemp/hpctmp/HPC_mini_workshop/Part3/firstname.lastname/ Now actually run multiQC. module load bbc/multiqc/multiqc-1.12 # multiqc creates the output directory automatically.
