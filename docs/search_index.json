Make sure you are on the VAI network, not VAI guest. Step 2. - For Mac user: open terminal, type ssh you_vai_user_name@submit.hpc.vai.org, and type your password. - For Windows user, open MobarXterm, click new session under “Session”. Click on “SSH”, type “submit.hpc.vai.org” as Remote host name, your user name for VAI as username, click “OK”. You need to type your VAI password. 2.2 Commands you need to learn for Ex2: Cmd1. pwd - displays the current working directory It is useful when directory changes are made frequently. Cmd2. ls - list content This command lists directory contents. Without anything specified after ls, it will list the current directory. It can also list content of another directory. You might not have any file in your home directory at this point, you can type touch file.txt to create your first file. ls /varidata/ ls -lht – show more details of the files. Cmd3. mkdir – create a new directory Syntax is mkdir new_directory name. You can create a new directory in the current directory or another directory. For example, mkdir projects will create a new directory called “projects” in your home directory. Cmd4. mv – move and rename file The arguments in mv are similar to the cp command. To move a file, syntax is mv file_name destination’s directory. For example: mv file.txt /home/username/projects, will move file.txt from current directory to /home/username/projects To rename a file, the syntax is mv old_file_name.txt new_file_name.txt Cmd5. cd – change directory Let’s say you’re in /home/username/ and you want to go to projects, a subdirectory of documents, type: cd projects Another scenario is if you want to switch to a completely new directory, for example, /home/username/research, you need to type cd followed by the directory’s absolute path: cd /home/username/research Tip, ./ means current working directory. ../ means the parent directory. / is the root directory, ~ is home directory. Pay attention to these differences. Cmd6. rm – remove a file rm file_name will delete the file. rm -r dir will delete the whole directory. Note, rm is permanent. Unlike Window and Mac where deleted files can be recovered from the Trash. Think carefully before you type rm. Cmd7. cp – copy a file or a dir Syntax: cp old_file new_file for file copy. cp -r old_dir new_dir for directory copy. Cmd8. find – look for a file based on its name Typical usage: find /home/username -name notes.txt will search for a file called notes.txt within your home directory and its subdirectories. Tip, if you want to find all pdf files under the current directory, do find . -name “*.pdf”. Here, * is called wildcard, it will match any name. 2.3 Ex2: file navigation Use the commands you just learned, go to /varidata/researchtemp/hpctmp/HPC_mini_workshop/Ex2 List files in this the directory, how many files and directories did you see? Which file was created the earliest? Make a new directory in your home directory called “hpc_mini_workshop” Try to copy (not to move) one of the fastsq files to hpc_mini_workshop you just created in your home directory. Use “find” command to list all the fastq files (file ends with fq) in /varidata/researchtemp/hpctmp/HPC_mini_workshop/Ex2 2.4 Commands you need to learn for Ex 3 Cmd9. head &amp; tail – view the first and last a few rows/lines of a file Usage: head -n 5 file_name will display as standard output (stdout) the first 5 lines/rows of the a file. Without -n, it will default display 10 lines. Cmd10. less &amp; more – view content of a file one page at a time. Tip, you can use q key to quit the viewing. Cmd11. cat – list the contents of a file as stdout cat (short for concatenate) is one of the most frequently used commands. To run this command, type cat followed by the file’s name: cat file.txt Combine two files: cat file1 file2 It is useful to pipe the content of the file into another command. 2.4.1 So, what is pipe? A pipe is a form of redirection (transfer of sdout to other destinations). You can send output from one command/program/process to another command/program/process for further processing. You can do so by using the pipe character |. Lastly, you can direct the stdout of any command to a new file use &gt;. For example: bwa mem genome.fa reads.fastq | samtools sort -o output.bam cat protein.fa | head -5 &gt; first_5_protein.fa Cmd 12. grep – search a pattern by line grep “GCGGA” sequence_file.fastq will output lines with GCGGA in it. Cmd 13. wc - counting words, lines, and bytes in files Without any specification, wc will output three numbers. The most useful is wc -l, it only outputs the line number. 2.5 Exercise 3: File viewing and manipulation Count how many lines in the fastq file you just copied to your home directory. Create a file that only has protein sequence name from file: /varidata/researchtemp/hpctmp/HPC_mini_workshop/Ex2/protein_seq.fa (please copy this file to your home directory first). Hint, use grep to look for pattern that is shared among all protein names; then use redirection to create a new file. Copy a different fastq file from /varidata/researchtemp/hpctmp/HPC_mini_workshop/Ex2/ to your home directory, and combine two fq files into a new file called combined.fq.

Two human paired-end samples (four total fastq files) have already been downloaded from GSE52778. To save time for the workshop, each file has been randomly subsetted to just a small fraction of the total reads. Here each user will: Copy these fastq files their own private project directory. Use basic Linux commands to learn some characteristics of these files. Use Salmon to align (pseudo-align) these reads to the hg38 reference transcriptome and get transcripts-per-million (TPMs) for each annotated gene. 4.1 Start an Interactive Job While simple file manipulations can be done on the submit node, computationally intensive operations should be performed using preallocated computational resources. An interactive job allows us to preallocate resources while still being able to run commands line by line. We will start an interactive job, requesting one CPU core and 6 hours of walltime. srun --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=1 --time=06:00:00 --pty bash After a job has been submitted, users can check on the status (e.g. how long it has been running) of it using the following. squeue -u username 4.2 Create Directory Create a project directory with a username and a sub-directory for storing raw sequence data file name fastqs in cd /varidata/researchtemp/hpctmp/HPC_mini_workshop/Part3 directory. Typically, one would work in their specific lab’s folder on the HPC. For this workshop, we will work in a common directory so that the instructors and chck on your progress. cd /varidata/researchtemp/hpctmp/BBC_workshop_June2023 Create a directory based on your username to separate your work from other users’. mkdir &lt;username&gt; Navigate to the username directory cd first.lastName Create a fastqs directory inside the username directory. It is good practice to keep your raw data separate from your analyses and never make changes to them directly. mkdir fastqs Use ls to confirm the fastqs directory was created. ls 4.3 Copy Fastq Files To fastqs subdirectory Verify the current directory is in the username directory. pwd Copy the 4 fastq.gz files and md5sum.txt, which you will use to check the validty of the files. cp /varidata/researchtemp/hpctmp/BBC/hpc_workshop_fqs/*fastq.gz ./fastqs/ cp /varidata/researchtemp/hpctmp/BBC/hpc_workshop_fqs/md5sum.txt ./fastqs/ Verify that the copied files are valid. The following code should return with an OK for each file. cd fastqs md5sum -c md5sum.txt ## SRR1039520_1.fastq.gz: OK ## SRR1039520_2.fastq.gz: OK ## SRR1039521_1.fastq.gz: OK ## SRR1039521_2.fastq.gz: OK Go back to the username directory. cd .. 4.4 Use basic Linux commands to explore the fastq files Notice all of the sequence data files end with a .gz extension, indicating they are gzip compressed. To view such files, one must use zcat instead of cat so that the files are decompressed into human-readable format. zcat fastqs/SRR1039520_1.fastq.gz | head ## @SRR1039520.19151550 19151550 length=63 ## CCAGGACATCAAGAAGCCAGCTGAAGATGAGTGGGGTAAAACCCCAGACGCCATGAAAGCTGC ## + ## HJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJIJJJJJJJJIJJJJJGGJJJFHIJIIJJIGHHFFFDDDDDCDDDCDD ## @SRR1039520.3404519 3404519 length=63 ## TGAGACATGGTTATAGATAAGAGAGTACAAAATGACTCTTTTTCCTGTCAATTGAAATTTAAA ## + ## HIGDFBGIIJBHGIIEHIIJIJIIIEGGIIIHGIJJIJJJIIJGIIIIGIEHIGDCHHIICG7 ## @SRR1039520.16253787 16253787 length=63 ## CAGGAGACCAAAGACACTGCAATTTGTGTGTTTTCTACAGGGTGCTTTAGATGACGTCTCATT zcat fastqs/SRR1039520_2.fastq.gz | head ## @SRR1039520.19151550 19151550 length=63 ## GAGATGGGGGTCCGTGCGGGCAGAACCCAGGGCATGAAGATCCAAAAGGGCCTGGTTCAGCTT ## + ## HJJJJJJJJJHHHIGIJIJJJJJJJHHHHFFFDDEEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD ## @SRR1039520.3404519 3404519 length=63 ## TTTGACCCTAGTATTGGCAATAGCCCTTTGCTATTTATATAATTAAAACTTTTCTTTAAATTT ## + ## HIJIJJJJIIEHGIGIIIDGIJJJJIIJJJIJJJIJJJIIIJJJJIJJGCHIJJJJJIJIJII ## @SRR1039520.16253787 16253787 length=63 ## TACAGTTTGCAAAAGATGTCCAGATGGGTTCTTCTCAAATGAGACGTCATCTAAAGCACCCTG Notice that SRR1039520_1.fastq.gz and SRR1039520_2.fastq.gz files have the same read IDs. Valid paired fastq files always have matching read IDs throughout the entire file. Next, we can figure out how many reads are in a fastq file using wc -l. Recall that each read is represented by 4 lines in a fastq file, so we need to divide the results of wc -l by 4 to get the number of reads. zcat fastqs/SRR1039520_1.fastq.gz | wc -l ## 2000000 Finally, we can use wc -m to figure out the read length in a fastq file. Below, we use a combination of head -n2 and tail -n1 to get the second line of the first read. You may notice that the results of wc -m will be 1 higher than the actual read length. This is because the tool counts the newline character also. zcat fastqs/SRR1039520_1.fastq.gz | head -n2 | tail -n1 | wc -m ## 64 4.5 Working With Environment Modules Type module av bbc2 (modules beginning with just bbc are from the old HPC) to see all the software installed by the BBC. There are a lot of modules installed; to parse through these more easily, we can pipe the results of module av into grep to search for modules with specific keywords. There is a trick, though. The results of module av go to standard error, so we need to redirect standard error to standard out using 2&gt;&amp;1 before the pipe. This command will output any modules containing the fastqc keyword. module av bbc2 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep &#39;fastqc&#39; ## bbc2/fastqc/fastqc-0.12.1 bbc2/pigz/pigz-2.7 bbc2/WiggleTools/WiggleTools-1.2.11 4.6 Run FastQC Create a fastqc directory inside of your username directory and run FastQC. module load bbc2/fastqc/fastqc-0.12.1 mkdir fastqc # Run FastQC.

The canonical transcript for MUC1 is ENST00000620103, so we will search for that using grep. grep &#39;ENST00000620103&#39; salmon/SRR1039520/quant.sf ## ENST00000620103.4 1811 1656.015 0.000000 0.000 Look for MUC1 across all the samples at the same time. We can see that ‘SRR1039521’ has a TPM of 13.1 for MUC1 compared to 0 for ‘SRR1039520’. Recall that the fastq files for this exercise were subsetted to a very small number of reads so don’t interpret these results seriously. grep &#39;ENST00000620103&#39; salmon/*/quant.sf ## salmon/SRR1039520/quant.sf:ENST00000620103.4 1811 1656.015 0.000000 0.000 ## salmon/SRR1039521/quant.sf:ENST00000620103.4 1811 1655.481 13.145898 5.723 4.12 BONUS: Use an interactive job to run multiQC on the Salmon and FastQC output In this final step, users will start an interactive job to perform multiQC to collect and summarize the outcomes from FastQC and Salmon, then evaluate the quality of the fastq sequences with the reference transcriptome(mapping rate).
